# Flask-MongoDB Web App

The title of my app is called Recipe Sharing Web App. This app allows users to share recipes with each other. A user is able to create a post 
through the submit a recipe page and filling in the corresponding boxes for the recipe title, recipe description, recipe ingredients, recipe instructions, as well as upload an image of the recipe. Once done, the post is added to the collection of recipes that has been already submitted and this is viewable through the all recipes page. The all recipes page can be modified as users are able to edit a post which takes them back to the submit a recipe page as well as completely delete a recipe submission. The Photo Gallery page allows users to see a collection of all the recipe images that were submitted and allows users to click on the recipe name which takes them to the all recipe page where they can the recipe posts and the details of the recipes.
